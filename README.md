# Iterator Challenge

Take a look at `my_utils.js`. Right now it only has a `myEach` function. Add the other iterators you built: i.e. `myMap`, `myReduce`. The goal of this exercise is for you to 1) use the utilities you've already built to solve the problems in this exersie, 2) build and extend the myUtils library with additional helper functions.
